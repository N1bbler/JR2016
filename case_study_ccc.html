                <p><strong>Type:</strong> Site Redesign</p>
                <p><strong>Category:</strong> Consumer-Facing Website</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Channel Cat Charters website is the online presence for the Channel Cat ship located in Santa Barbara Harbor, SB, CA. The site is used as a sales and marketing tool, as well as to demonstrate the qualities and features of the Channel Cat charter experience to potential clientele. The business caters to a high-end audience and offers individualized and highly personalized service. The (now former) site was launched in 2007. While it served them well for many years, it was built with legacy technology (Flash, Java applets) and was no longer working for them or many of their clients. This resulted in lost booking opportunities, as well as having to guide clients through the site, which was expensive in terms of time allocation. Previously, the site did not include any analytics solution, so measuring these lost opportunities was impossible.</p>

            <div class="col m12 l6">
                 <p><strong>Purpose of the site:</strong></p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>For clientele to see the beauty, size, and overall grandeur of the ship and then to contact the Charter Agent for a booking</li>
                        <li>For Charter Agent and other stakeholders to use the site as a sales and marketing tool</li>
                    </ul>
                <p><strong>Goals for the redesign:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make Virtual Tours work across devices, the tours are a big selling point</li>
                        <li>Make Video interview with <i>Extreme Yachts</i> television show work across devices</li>
                        <li>Update the Directions to be more clear, requires custom map routes as the mailing address is not the same as the boarding location</li>
                        <li>Make it easier for Users to navigate the content itself (not in tiny window frame)</li>
                    </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="col m12 l6">
                <p><strong>Problems to Solve:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Site too small on modern monitors, difficult to navigate as content is shown in tiny window</li>
                        <li>Home page animation broken on mobile (Flash-based)</li>
                        <li>Virtual Tours broken on mobile, or in some Desktop browsers (Java-applet based)</li>
                        <li>Video tour broken on mobile (Flash-based)</li>
                        <li>Gallery broken on mobile (Flash-based), difficult to navigate</li>
                        <li>Site required walk-through guidance to use</li>
                        <li>Directions need to be reworked, but cannot use physical address</li>
                    </ul>
                <p><strong>Technical Challenges:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most Virtual Tour software tends to be Java based, produce Java applet output</li>
                        <li>Video content is embedded in Flash, only source available</li>
                    </ul>

                <p><strong>Preliminary Client notes:</strong>

                        <li>Wants Big beautiful pictures</li>
                        <li>Believes "Less is more" with marketing verbiage, wants pictures to speak for themselves</li>
                        <li>Client is a Senior Citizen that struggles a bit with computers and technology; ease of use, large images and scalable text is key</li>
                        <li>Client is not interested in going the route of a booking and reservation system; as a high-end chartering business with an exclusive clientele, they hold the customer's hands through every step of the booking process.</li>
                        <li>Client can send images via email, but many initial images sent are low-resoluton thumbnail images</li>

                            <li>It is important to the client to not crop the sail off of (at least the majority) of the images</li>
                            <li>Client wants full-screen images on the homepage, without any overlay text.</li>
                            <li>Client *loved* the idea of a slideshow (or carousel) of selected images on the homepage</li>
                            <li>Client likes the new/improved navigational model proposed</li>
                            <li>Client likes the proposed Call-To-Action model, is OK with it being "below the fold" on the homepage</li>

                        <ul>

                            <li>Client wanted 7-10 images instead of 3 in Carousel</li>
                            <li>In Tablet Portrait view we would switch to mobile navigation mode</li>

                            <li>Complementary tints and shades would be used for interaction</li>
                            <li>We would drop the green color from the mobile menu, as it distracts</li>

                        <li>Moved the Virtual Tours to their own page and added <i>Extreme Yachts</i> video after extracting it from previous Flash source and converting it to use modern web codecs, which allowed for native HTML5 playback</li>
                        <li>Added tons of content to the Gallery, moved images around and randomized things a bit for a more interesting presentation</li>
                        <li>Added remainder of content to the About page and worked heavily on the typography for this text-heavy page, utilizing smart quotes and responsive text, as well as numerous stylistic type treatments</li>
                        <li>Built the Contact page around the <a href="#an-cta">Call-to-Action design</a> which is at the bottom of each page on the site. Also added full-screen background of the crew to also convey to the user they are in the right place</li>

            <h3>Communicate, Review, Refine</h3>
            <p>I continued working until the site was close to complete. At this point, I reviewed with the client again, and they were ecstatic. They were ready to launch the new site immediately. I explained there was some work to be done to optimize the site for best performance. Additionally, I suggested that we implement Google Analytics in order to measure and learn from the site's users going forward. Finally, although cross-browser testing and mobile tests had occurred throughout the design and development cycles, I wanted to do one last round of thorough checking and capture screenshots as well.</p>

            <h3>Final Phase</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented Google Analytics across all pages on the site</li>
                <li>General code cleanup and formatting</li>
                <li>Double-checked to ensure all images had been optimized</li>
                <li>Minified all CSS used on the site and relinked to new minified files</li>
                <li>Extensive cross-platform and cross-browser testing on desktop; Windows: FF, Chrome, and IE; Mac OS: Safari, Chrome, and Firefox</li>
                <li>One minor display bug was found on Safari for IOS, which I was able to quickly fix with some custom CSS</li>
                <li>Mobile testing on Android (Chrome), no issues noted</li>
                <li>Committed final code edits to Github repo</li>
                <li>Backed up and then took down the old site, as well as the test/ remote staging site, and replaced with the new site</li>
                <li>Performed another round of testing on the live site to ensure all was well</li>
                <li>Ran into a couple of unexpected issues, which turned out to be merely file permissions related. CHMOD to the rescue.</li>
                <li>Checked Google Analytics statistics to ensure all was working (24 hours for complete stats)</li>

            <p><strong>What went well?</strong> Business problems solved. User needs addressed. Technical challenges conquered. Analytics added. Desktop and Mobile testing successful. Project completed on time and on budget. <strong>Results:</strong> Immense client satisfaction!</p>
            <p><strong>What didn't go so well?</strong> Wait times for images and verbiage content from client were at times lengthy. Some low-resolution content (video, virtual tours, a couple of the gallery images) had to be used as no higher-quality content available.</p>
            <p><strong>What would I do differently if starting over?</strong> Establish firmer deadlines to receive content and follow up on it. Ensure all content is of sufficient quality and ready to go beforehand.</p>
            <p class="no-bdr"><strong>How well did the process work?</strong> Kanban was a good approach for this project, communication levels were good, iterations went smoothly; overall process was effective with very positive results. </p>
